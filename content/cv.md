I’m a motivated backend developer continuously learning new skills, techniques and technologies.

Caring about the presentation and accuracy of my work, I am logical and thorough in my coding.<br />
Preferring to find elegant and robust solutions to problems, I craft aesthetic and readable code to future-proof for future developers.

However, I’m most involved with the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) community - being an [active contributor](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-4-argon2i-password-hasher) to both the [core framework](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits?author=zanbaldwin) and [documentation](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/commits?author=zanbaldwin), plus being a [keynote speaker for the SymfonyLive London 2018](https://london2018.live.symfony.com/speakers#session-2670) conference.
