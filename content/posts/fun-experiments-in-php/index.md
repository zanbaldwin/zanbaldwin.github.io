    I'll show you the crazy things you can do in PHP with streams and autoloader overloading to write your own language features, including generics. I'll also show you how you can supercharge your applications using aspect-oriented programming or encrypt source code on-the-fly using only PHP. As if that wasn't enough, we'll go even further and make PHP a polyglot language by importing esoteric language scripts!
    These aren't your average hacks and shouldn't be run in production... but let's explore these concepts as fun experiments so you'll never think of PHP as boring again!
