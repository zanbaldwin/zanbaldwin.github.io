With many years developing in object-orientated PHP following industry best
practices, managing to always deploy up-to-date PHP versions to production, I
build fault-tolerant RESTful Hypermedia APIs and web applications that scale
with high performance. Preferring to find elegant and robust solutions to
problems, I craft aesthetic and readable code to future-proof for other
developers.

My experience tends heavily towards data-centric solutions relying on multiple
types of storage including relational databases, NoSQL, and key-value stores. I
am just as comfortable using database libraries as I am writing raw SQL for edge
cases. 

I enjoy architecting solutions to problems, from designing applications using
various methodologies covering security to <abbr title="Internationalisation">i18n</abbr>,
all the way to entire containerized environment stacks with all its moving parts
(app, web server, data stores, cache, message queue, etc). I am most comfortable
on a Linux environment, whether that be a local or remote, desktop or
orchestration services.

Caring about the presentation and accuracy of my work I am logical and thorough
in my coding, profiling performance to make optimizations where I can, and
utilizing continuous integration to automate unit tests and behavioural
integration testing.

As a developer I'm not the greatest wordsmith in the world but I do make an
effort to maintain documentation, both technical and non-technical, for the
things I build; being able to help stakeholders visualize processes through
tools such as specifications, requirements and user-guides is an important tool
to improve and streamline those already in place.

I passionate about constantly learning new things in a hands-on approach and if
practical, willing to throw away my own code the moment a better solution
presents itself. I'm involved in this industry beyond just a day job because I
believe in community; I have great interest in sharing knowledge with others,
advocating communication by collaborating with my peers, and leading others to
their potential by mentoring whenever I can to pay forward everything I am
constantly learning from those with more experience than me. I've recently been
experimenting with modern compiled languages; Golang for small pieces of project
functionality, and Rust in non-professional settings.

# Contributions

I've made open-source contributions to many vendors such as The PHP League,
PHP-FIG, Yii Framework and CakePHP, along with publishing an [IP abstraction
library][ip] that is actively used. I'm most involved with the
[Symfony][symfony] community - being an [active contributor][argon2i] to both
the [core framework][core] and [documentation][docs], part of the Diversity
Initiative, and a [keynote speaker][keynote] for the *SymfonyLive London 2018*
conference.

I'm a current committee member of Brighton Pride, part of a community-based
events company called Crew Salam that's gained a reputable following in the UK
and European festival industry, and previously a crew and committee member of
the largest medieval reenactment festival in Europe.

Member (and previous host) for [PHPSW][phpsw]. Member/co-host of various other,
non-industry related community groups in the Bristol area. I'm already
interested in getting involved with similar communities in Vancouver and will
obviously be decreasing my responsibilities in the UK over the course of 2019.
