With many years developing in object-orientated PHP following industry best practices I build high-performance, fault-tolerant RESTful Hypermedia APIs and web applications that scale. Preferring to find elegant and robust solutions to problems, I craft aesthetic and readable code to future-proof for other developers.

I enjoy architecting solutions to problems, from designing applications using various methodologies (MVC, DDD, CQRS, etc) to entire containerized environment stacks with all its moving parts (app, server, data stores, cache, message queue, etc).

Caring about the presentation and accuracy of my work I am logical and thorough in my coding, profiling performance and making optimisations where I can, and utilising continuous integration to automate unit tests and bahvioural integration testing.

I passionate about constantly learning new things in a hands-on approach and, if practical, willing to throw away my own code the moment a better solution presents itself. I believe in community and so have great interest in sharing knowledge with others, advocating communication by collaborating with my peers, and leading others to their potential by mentoring whenever I can to pay forward everything I am constantly learning from those with more experience than me.

# Contributions

I've made open-source contributions to many vendors such as The PHP League, PHP-FIG,
Yii Framework and CakePHP, along with publishing an [IP abstraction library](https://github.com/darsyn/ip)
that is actively used. I'm most involved with the [Symfony](https://symfony.com)
community - being an [active contributor](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-4-argon2i-password-hasher)
to both the [core framework](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits?author=zanbaldwin)
and [documentation](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/commits?author=zanbaldwin),
part of the Diversity Initiative, and a [keynote speaker](https://london2018.live.symfony.com/speakers#session-2670)
for the *SymfonyLive London 2018* conference.

I'm a current committee member of Brighton Pride, part of a community-based events company
called Crew Salam that's gained a reputable following in the UK and European festival
industry, and previously a crew and committee member of the largest medieval reenactment
festival in Europe.

Member (and previous host) for [PHPSW](http://phpsw.uk). Member/co-host of various other,
non-industry related community groups in the Bristol area. I will obviously be decreasing
my responsibilities in the UK, but am already interested in getting involved with similar
communities in Vancouver.
