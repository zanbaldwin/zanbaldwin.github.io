I’m an experienced and motivated back-end software developer continuously learning new
skills, techniques and technologies. Caring about the presentation and accuracy of my
work, I am logical and thorough in my coding. Preferring to find elegant and robust
solutions to problems, I craft aesthetic and readable code to future-proof for
myself and other developers.

# Contributions

I've made open-source contributions to many vendors such as The PHP League, PHP-FIG,
Yii Framework and CakePHP, along with publishing an [IP abstraction library](https://github.com/darsyn/ip)
that is actively used. I'm most involved with the [Symfony](https://symfony.com)
community - being an [active contributor](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-4-argon2i-password-hasher)
to both the [core framework](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits?author=zanbaldwin)
and [documentation](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/commits?author=zanbaldwin),
part of the Diversity Initiative, and a [keynote speaker](https://london2018.live.symfony.com/speakers#session-2670)
for the *SymfonyLive London 2018* conference.

I'm a current committee member of Brighton Pride, part of a community-based events company
called Crew Salam that's gained a reputable following in the UK and European festival
industry, and previously a crew and committee member of the largest medieval reenactment
festival in Europe.

Member (and previous host) for [PHPSW](http://phpsw.uk). Member/co-host of various other,
non-industry related community groups in the Bristol area. I will obviously be decreasing
my responsibilities in the UK, but am already interested in getting involved with similar
communities in Vancouver.
