        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            One of my best friends, Molly, is starting a magazine called <strong>The Well</strong> with her sisters (a
            weird but awesome combination of wellbeing, sisterhood, art, psychological sciences, etc). As a straight
            white cis woman she's trying her best for the first issue to showcase a wide range of diverse voices, and
            wants to include an article or feature on any transition stories around the theme/topic of resilience that
            people are willing to tell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Molly was the first person I came out as trans to and has been one of my biggest supporters, so of course I
            want to help her create a piece that supports the trans community, especially when it seems all the articles
            about us in the media seem to transform transphobia into the nations favourite pastime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, she likes my tone of writing and thinks my humour is "dry" and "witty" even though most of my
            writing experience is for technical conference talks (sidenote, I just write the same way I talk to her when
            trying to deal with her personality which is way too peppy and upbeat for her own good). It might also have
            something to do with how she "[doesn't] want to butcher a community I only know about through you". How
            annoyingly considerate of her.<br>
            I, being the idiot I am, agreed to this so now I've got to pretend to be a <em>writer</em>  or whatever.
            Molly, the person who actually studied journalism at university, will be assisting me to make sure the end
            product doesn't end up sounding like hot garbage.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about">About The Story</h3>
        <p>
            The magazine, and it's overall theme of sisterhood, is primarily aimed for an audience of
            <a href="#magazine" title="Explaining the use of the word womxn">womxn</a>. However I will be writing the
            article itself with the target audience of the trans community in mind (and possibly publishing it around
            trans spaces too), meaning all experiences, stories, and perspectives are welcome including non-binary and
            transmasculine. A story without diversity of thought is only half told.
        </p>
        <p>
            The theme of the issue is RESILIENCE (apparently the all-caps part is important).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Resilience</strong> <em>noun</em>, <code>rɪˈzɪlɪəns</code></p>
        <ol>
            <li>the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The aim is to elevate trans voices into the wellbeing space by opening up discussion around the theme of
            resilience during transition and beyond. To showcase the everyday strength of the trans community while
            navigating a cis world.
        </p>
        <p>What do you interpret resilience to be? What does it mean to you?</p>

        <h4 id="goal">End Goal</h4>
        <p>
            A feature-length article that will spotlight a significant story or narrative from one or more people,
            supported by a series of shorter anecdotes, followed by a collection of quotes of peoples thoughts
            and feelings around resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Well will take this article and intends to run it across a double page spread - one side for the main
            stories in feature format and the other for the supporting anecdotes with an artsy collage of quotations.
        </p>

        <h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
        <p>
            The first issue is scheduled to be published on the spring equinox (20<sup>th</sup> March 2021), and a final
            draft of the article will ideally be ready by the first week of March.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can contribute any way that you feel comfortable. That could be an informal discussion over email, chat
            or voice call; you can ask for some interview-style questions to use as prompts; if you already know what
            you want to say you can submit a one-off story or anecdote; you can even send me a long rant if you want to
            (I know I've needed to in the past).<br>
            If there's another way you can think of, let me know! I'll accommodate you to the best of my ability.
        </p>
        <p>Example questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How would you like to be referred to as?
                For example, your name, a pseudonym, some really boring title like <em>Anonymous User #3</em>, etc.
            </li>
            <li>What are your pronouns?</li>
            <li>What does the word "resilience" means to you?</li>
            <li>
                The story or narrative you want to tell. If you'd like prompts to get you started, try:
                <ul>
                    <li>How are you, as a human being living in this world, resilient?</li>
                    <li>How are you resilient in ways a cis person isn't?</li>
                    <li>How has being trans changed your outlook of what being "tough" is?</li>
                    <li>What makes you feel strong, or makes you feel like you have the strength to overcome things?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything you are now quick to recover from that you weren't so quick at in the past?</li>
                    <li>
                        Has being trans made you more resilient against things you didn't expect? Is there anything that
                        is less difficult now that you are trans?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What has been the biggest challenge on your journey so far? How did you, or are still trying
                        to, overcome that?
                    </li>
                    <li>Has there been anything significant that brought you peace, in a time when you needed it?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any self-care practices or rituals in place to help you cultivate resilience?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                How you think your story would differ if you'd been asked when we weren't a year into a global pandemic
                and national lockdown?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h3>
        <p>
            The story will be checked and edited by other committee members of <a href="https://transpridebrighton.org">
            Trans Pride Brighton</a> (who have kindly volunteered) to make sure no mistakes slip through unintentionally.
        </p>
        <p>
            A final draft will be sent to everyone involved (that provides a method to contact them) so that they have
            the option to be removed if they aren't comfortable with what's written.<br>
            <small>Or so help me God I will fly to London despite the pandemic and smash Molly's precious Macbook.</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            No identifying information will be published in the final article without explicit written consent.
        </p>

        <h3 id="magazine">About The Magazine</h3>
        <p>
            About the use of the word <strong>womxn</strong>. Yes, it's possibly problamatic with some people in the
            trans community. I just couldn't think of another word that summed up <em>women and non-binary folk that
            feel a connection to sisterhood and maybe some men as well, hell I ain't gonna judge</em>.
