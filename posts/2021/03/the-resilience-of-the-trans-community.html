        <p class="lead">
            Is the trans community resilient? Yes, the clue’s in the title. But I wish we lived in a world where I
            didn’t know the answer to that question.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted this to be a happy, positive piece about my community, but it wasn’t until I started writing did I
            realise how desensitized I’ve become to how fucking <em>depressing</em> it all is. Our community is strong,
            it’s resilient, it’s our everyday. Sure, there are times where we have to take a step back because it’s
            overwhelming, but we do not give up. We can’t, not when certain individuals vehemently hate us simply for
            being ourselves. No one should ever have to live with the very real fear of being hurt, of being killed, for
            no other reason than someone decided that their violence is an acceptable response to your mere existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UK’s Equality Act 2010 is a good piece of legislation. Trans people are protected under law from
            discrimination. Apart from, y’know, all the bits in other laws that make it legal to discriminate: no legal
            ban on conversion therapy, no legal right to religious marriage, no legal gender recognition without a
            mental health diagnosis, no legal gender recognition without spousal consent (without their consent you’d
            have to divorce them before your gender would be legally recognised), no legal parenthood recognition (that
            is, even if a trans man was legally recognised as male under UK law it still requires him to be listed as
            the mother of his child).
        </p>
        <p>
            But while legislation is one thing, the reality of the situation in day-to-day Britain isn’t the same. For
            everyone thinking what’s so bad about living in a Western developed country, a British trans woman was
            granted asylum by New Zealand in 2017 due to transphobia<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. Not moved,
            granted asylum. Laws mean nothing when your community is in the crosshairs for the nation's
            socially-acceptable outlet for its bigotry. Recorded transphobic hate crime has doubled in the last three
            years (and approximately only 1 in 7 victims are reporting their experiences)<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup>.<br>
            And don’t even get me started on practical access to trans healthcare: following a freedom of information
            request on 19th January 2021, The Laurels (one of only 7 gender clinics in the country, the one I was
            referred to) has current waiting times of up to 5.7 years (2092 days) - since December 2019 only 2 patients
            have been assessed out of a current backlog of 2592<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup>. TWO.
        </p>
        <p>
            I gave up waiting and moved to another country before I felt like I was being taken seriously, before I felt
            like I was being treated like a human being.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re aware that it’s a small, vocal minority that are actively fighting against us - but when that small
            minority is given a platform by the government and media<sup><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup>, when other
            people don’t speak up against them, are they really a minority? Just with every other marginalized group on
            this planet, if you choose to remain silent you choose the side of the oppressor.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <q>If only I was doing an article about memeology.</q>
            <p>
                I wanted to say something about the stereotypes people have about us. But then I realised that most of
                the stereotypes about trans people I know… are by trans people, mostly in meme format. Seriously, we
                have an entire subreddit<sup><a href="#footnote_5">5</a></sup> dedicated to said memes about ourselves
                (“grab your hoodie! It’s pickle time!”).
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Before you start to wonder “but think of the children!” someone already did. The UK’s High Court, on the
            1<sup>st</sup> of December 2020, effectively ruled that trans children under the age of 18 cannot consent to
            puberty blockers, the exact same medication prescribed for precocious (early onset)
            puberty<sup><a href="#footnote_6">6</a></sup> in cis children and is completely reversible. A trans teenager
            can have sex, have a driving (or pilot’s!) license, consent to elective medical surgeries, get married, join
            the armed forces (?!), but they apparently lack the maturity to know who they are as a person.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <q>Thought Experiment:</q>
            <p>
                In the 12 months leading up to April 2020, 2372 children of puberty age<sup><a href="#footnote_7">7</a></sup>
                (over 12 but not yet legal adults) were referred to the UK’s Gender Identity Development Services - for
                simplicity, we’ll assume  they all chose to medically transition and are an even split of gender. Can
                you imagine randomly selecting 1182 teenage girls in that age group from schools all across the country
                and telling them they have no choice but to be prescribed testosterone, until they reach the age in
                which they are legally allowed to choose not to take it? Could you imagine the long-term consequences
                of that person’s emotional, mental and physical development and the stigma that would follow them for
                the rest of their lives?
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            It’s heartwarming to see the number of referals to Gender Identity Clinics increase every year, meaning
            awareness and acceptance is growing while more and more people feel safe enough to come out, following the
            same trend gay people had in the 80’s. It means more and more people are understanding themselves at a
            younger age - a stark contrast to the majority of my school years during the tail end of Section 28 where it
            was <strong>literally illegal</strong> to be taught about this stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our identity and authenticity is questioned because the assumption is that we’re brought up as another
            gender, whereas in reality that isn’t the case. I wasn’t raised as either male or
            female<sup><a href="#footnote_8">8</a></sup>, my upbringing was confusing. I just learnt to think I was bad
            at life. A mishmash of opposing internal and external forces, never knowing why I was so uncomfortable,
            feeling like I was a misfit who was failing at growing up. Failing at being alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yeah, we’re resilient. Shit, don’t we know it. But it’s not something thrust upon us, it’s
            learnt - hopefully your learning curve is a little less steep than ours.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Whether you can be said to have [resilience] or not largely depends not on any particular psychological
            test but on the way your life unfolds. If you are lucky enough to never experience any sort of adversity, we
            won’t know how resilient you are”<sup><a href="#footnote_9">9</a></sup>. It’s not exactly a secret that the
            trans community faces struggle and adversity all around the world, we get a lot of practice in the art of
            recovering from difficulties - but while it highlights our resilience it’s not the source of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In psychology, resilience is defined by something called the “internal locus of control”. It’s the degree to
            which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces (beyond their influence), have control over
            the outcome of events in their lives. That is how much you attribute your success to your own efforts and
            abilities rather than luck, chance or fate (which is referred to as an external locus of control). Think of
            it as the scientific way of describing the idea “I control my own destiny”.<br>
            A person who expects to succeed will be more motivated and more likely to learn. A person with an external
            locus of control, who attributes his or her success to luck or fate, will be less likely to make the effort
            needed to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously it’s not quite as simple as just believing in yourself. You can’t march on down to Downing Street,
            shout "you've been a very naughty boy!" while wagging your finger, and magically fix the economy or suddenly
            find the NHS' missing £350million.
        </p>
        <p>
            Resilience is not a “natural talent” that some are gifted with, nor does it mean that resilient people don’t
            experience less distress, grief or anxiety than others<sup><a href="#footnote_10">10</a></sup>. It seems the
            factors resulting in resilience are an individual’s history and social support; close personal
            relationships, especially with parents and primary caregivers<sup><a href="#footnote_11">11</a></sup>, help
            develop resilience early.<br>
            Resilience is a learned skill that is learnt as you age. It is advantageous to learn at a young age, but
            that applies to almost everything in life. That didn’t stop John Glenn going into space at 77, Yūichirō
            Miura climbing Everest at 80, or Harry Bernstein publishing his first book at 96. The best time to start
            anything is right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The deliberate act of coming out and transitioning is a very public declaration of how strong your internal
            locus of control is. It’s grabbing the steering wheel of life and sailing straight into the choppy waters
            marked “here be dragons”.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Queer people don't grow up as ourselves, we grow up playing a version of ourselves that sacrifices
            authenticity to minimise humiliation & prejudice. The massive task of our adult lives is to unlock which
            parts of ourselves are truly us & which parts we've created to protect
            us.”<sup><a href="#footnote_12">12</a></sup><br>
            First we have to deal with guilt; having to learn to forgive ourselves for not figuring it out sooner, or
            suppressing our identity from the fear of going against society. The next process requires enormous
            introspection to discover the real you under the layers of societal expectations. It can be hard, it can be
            messy, you can functionally be a completely different person on the other side: ego death - the complete
            transformation of the psyche or self-identity<sup><a href="#footnote_13">13</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So why do we transition? Why do we go through all this when an easier route through life has been laid out
            before us? Many people who are far more eloquent with words have given satisfactory answers when pressed,
            but the automatic answer given by the majority of people spoken to is just “because I had to”. I’m not sure
            it’s a feeling that can be put into words. It’s just something for us to know and you to put down as one of
            the many mysteries of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            The absolute worst part about writing this article was talking to other trans people and realising that the
            words we spoke only referenced shared feelings and experiences that, on paper, could never truly describe it
            in enough detail for cis people to comprehend. The infuriating realisation that we all have these ideas,
            these experiences, these complex layers of emotions that, to be honest, we don’t know how to properly share
            with the other people in our lives.<br>
            This may contribute to why we’re told simultaneously that we’re “too young to know” and “why didn’t we
            figure it out sooner?”
        </p>
        <aside>
            <q>Is this relevant? No. I just wanted to talk about awesome toys.</q>
            <p>
                I didn’t exactly figure out my fundamental identity by playing dress-up or playing with girls toys.
                Besides I don’t like dresses, they clash too much with my personal aesthetic of “anti-social programmer
                who lives in her parent’s basement”, and my favourite toys as a child were anything with moving
                parts - especially if they could be used as projectiles.<br>
                The most memorable toy of my childhood were my sister’s Sky Dancers<sup><a href="#footnote_14">14</a></sup>,
                once lovingly referred to as “the gayest thing in the world”<sup><a href="#footnote_15">15</a></sup> and
                also, you guessed it, recalled in 2000 by the manufacturer after over 100 reported injuries. They were
                both queer as fuck and bloody dangerous. What more could you ask for?
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            I avoid telling people my discovery process, I’m afraid they’ll simplify it to “a YouTube video turned me
            trans”. A single video a year or two before the start of the modern shitstorm of media controversy from a
            then-obscure YouTuber was recommended to me (yeah, thanks Google Algorithm, you could have mentioned
            something sooner); it was informative and relatable, explaining what was actually happening to them and
            their roadmap for the future and it hit me with “holy shit, that’s a thing? I can do that?!”. It was a
            Thursday night. I cried, a lot. Fucking hell, was I scared. Terrified. I didn’t want to go through all that
            but… not doing it just wasn’t an option.
        </p>
        <p>
            The closest feeling I can compare it to is the shock of opening an email from a sender you don’t recognise
            asking you to present the closing keynote at a conference - your mind rushing with possibilities of the
            future. Except you’re having a breakdown at the same time. In reality, it was just me lying on my bed
            scrolling through the internet because I didn’t want to go to sleep yet, but that night is seared into my
            memory.<br>
            The first time I took estrogen, the packet had been hidden in my drawer for 88 days because I had been too
            scared to take it until then. It didn’t feel like a choice then either, inevitability never does.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re unlikely to ever go through something quite so extreme, but when we’re told "that's just how the
            world works get used to it" resilience is the simple act of saying "no, I won’t settle for this". You take
            baby steps, putting one foot in front of the other, knowing that you can always go back to the last
            checkpoint if you need to until, one day, you realise you have no intention of ever going back.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes I can transition. Yes I can write that article about resilience. Yes I'm capable of more than I thought
            I was. You’re going to get it wrong, and then get it wrong again. And again, and again. Keep taking those
            steps until one day you look back at where you’ve come from and realise the only way is forward. You only
            fail by giving up on yourself.
