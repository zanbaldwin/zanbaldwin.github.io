        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>She/her.</p>
        <p>
            Currently living in my fourth country as an immigrant in The Netherlands, working remotely as a Software
            Developer. I spend my time volunteering on a Pride committee, with Symfony as a Diversity Initiative guidance
            team member and CARE team member, open-source community groups, animal shelters, festivals &amp; travelling
            (on hiatus due to COVID), and an unhealthy amount of hours buried between the electronic pages of a Kindle
            (do not underestimate the power of a hermit that voraciously reads an average of 100k words a day) - all
            while resisting the stereotypical British compulsion for cups of tea and queueing.
