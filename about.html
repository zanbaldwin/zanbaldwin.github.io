        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>She/her.</p>
        <p>
            Currently living as an immigrant in The Netherlands. A cat person constantly covered in dog hair, with a stereotypical
            British compulsion for cups of tea and queueing.
        </p>
        <p>Interests include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calligraphy</li>
            <li>Festivals; however, I've worked the festival circuit for so many years it feels weird to go as a regular customer</li>
            <li>Fan fiction AU; I get a weird sense of satisfaction when people take original work and twist it into ways completely unintended by the original author.</li>
        </ul>
